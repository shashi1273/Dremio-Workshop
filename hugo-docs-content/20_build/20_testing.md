## Testing

Once you feel your workshop is complete, have a few other people test it. At this point you will probably need technical people to test it as the flow may be a little rough.  `hugo` with no options will generate an html site in `/public`. But it's also fairly easy to run `hugo server` and connect to `localhost:1313` to view the workshop.

Once you have ironed out flow issues, have a few non-technical check the site for grammatical errors.  If you are using an IDE, which I hope you are, install or setup spell check to catch some mistakes early.

#### Some things to check for

* Check for flow and make sure that someone following the instructions can complete the workshop
* Make sure there are no errors when going through the different steps
* Check all links in the workshop and the navigation
* Check the `search` functionality
* Ensure you cleaned up all resources
