## FAQ's

<h4 align="left">
Why do you use Cloud9?
</h4>

<p style="text-align:left;">A. When conducting workshops it is often difficult to determine the state of the users workstation and validate that all dependencies and requirements are installed.  With Cloud9 we get a capable IDE and shell access to the AWS account.  Git, aws-cli, programming languages, and many other tools are pre-installed which allows us to start everyone from a known state and not have to fumble around with missing components from someones workstation.  

<h4 align="left">
Can I change the License
</h4>

<p style="text-align:left;">A. We rather you not.  The site will be posted at aws-samples and the license included in the sample is MIT, which is meant to be simple and open source friendly.  

<h4 align="left">
What if I want to use other tools, such as Jenkins or Terraform as examples?
</h4>

<p style="text-align:left;">A.  Great. We actually encourage you to use other tools and services as you may expect customers to use this in their environment.  Note that if you choose to use additional or alternative tools that it's easy for the end user to follow and does not detract from your main message.  As an example, if your main message is application security scanning, does it make a difference whether you use Jenkins or CodeBuild, or does the usage of one or the other add unnecessary complexity that has nothing to do with your message?  So don't reinvent the wheel and if there is already an example of instrumenting testing in CodeBuild, I would use that as the tool has nothing to do with your message.  But if your main message is instrumenting security scanning on Jenkins, then yes, use Jenkins.
