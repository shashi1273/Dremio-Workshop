In order for you to succeed in this workshop, you will need to run through a few steps in order to properly setup and configure your environment. These steps will include provisioning some services, installing some tools, and downloading some dependencies as well. We will begin with [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/). Technically, you should be able to complete many of the steps in these modules if you have a properly configured terminal. However, in order to avoid the *"works on my machine"* response you've surely experienced at some point in your career, I strongly encourage you to proceed with launching Cloud9.

{{% notice tip %}}
[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects.
